📘 Library Book Management System

📝 Project Description

This Library Book Management System is a Python console application that helps you practice Python basics (variables, typecasting, operators, lists, strings, dictionaries, sets, tuples, loops, and conditionals) before transitioning to OOP.

It allows you to add, view, update, delete, and search books in a library, displaying data cleanly and interactively in the terminal.

🎯 Features :

✅ Add a new book with details (title, author, year, ISBN, availability status)

✅ Display all books in a clean, readable table

✅ Search for a book by ISBN

✅ Update the status of a book (borrowed/available)

✅ Delete a book from the library

✅ Display unique authors present in the library

✅ View library statistics (total books, published years, list of authors, list of books)

✅ CLI menu for easy navigation

⚙️ How It Works :

📌 Uses a dictionary (Books) to store:

Key: ISBN (integer, unique)

Value: List containing [Title, Author, Year of Publish, Status]

📌 Uses loops to present a CLI menu and handle user choices until exit.

📌 Uses lists, sets, and typecasting to manage and display library data.

📌 Uses functions for modular, clean code structure.

🚀 How to Run :

1️⃣ Ensure Python (3.x recommended) is installed on your system.

2️⃣ Download or copy book_management_system.py into your working directory.

3️⃣ Run the program:

python book_management_system.py

4️⃣ Follow the CLI prompts:

1. Add Book
2. Display All Books
3. Search Book By ISBN
4. Update Book Status
5. Delete Book
6. Display Unique Authors
7. Show Library Statistics
8. Exit

5️⃣ Enter the corresponding number to perform library management tasks interactively.

💡 Concepts Practiced :

✅ Data structures: dict, list, tuple, set

✅ Typecasting, string manipulation (.title(), .lower())

✅ Loops (while, for)

✅ Conditionals (if, elif, else)

✅ CRUD operations in a practical scenario

✅ Building a structured CLI project in procedural Python

🛠️ Requirements

✅ Python 3.x

✅ No external libraries required
