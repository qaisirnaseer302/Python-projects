 Student Marks Management System
-->Project Description
This Student Marks Management System is a Python console application designed to help you practice Python basics.
It allows you to:

Add, view, update, delete student records

Search students by roll number

Display unique marks

Calculate class statistics (average, highest, lowest)

It uses variables, typecasting, operators, lists, strings, dictionaries, sets, tuples, loops, and conditionals, reinforcing your pre-OOP Python concepts through practical CLI project work.

🎯 Features
✅ Add new students (name, roll number, marks)
✅ Display all student records
✅ Search for a student by roll number
✅ Update marks for a student
✅ Delete a student record
✅ Display all unique marks in the class
✅ Display average, highest, and lowest marks
✅ CLI-based clean menu for easy navigation

⚙️ How It Works
Uses a dictionary (Students) to store data with:

Key: roll number (int)

Value: [name (str), marks (int)]

Uses loops to present a menu and handle user interaction continuously.

Uses list comprehensions to extract and process marks for statistics.

Uses sets to show unique marks in the class.

Uses basic functions to organize and structure logic.

🚀 How to Run
1️⃣ Ensure you have Python installed (3.x recommended).

2️⃣ Download or copy the projecct_1.py file.

3️⃣ Run the program:

python projecct_1.py

4️⃣ Follow the CLI prompts:

1. Add Student
2. Display All Students
3. Search Student by Roll Number
4. Update Student Marks
5. Delete Student
6. Display Unique Marks
7. Display Class Statistics
8. Exit
5️⃣ Enter your choice to manage student data.

💡 What You Will Learn
✅ Data structures (dict, list, tuple, set)
✅ CLI user interaction
✅ Typecasting user input
✅ Basic validation practices
✅ CRUD operations in Python
✅ Applying operators and loops practically
✅ Modular programming using functions

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x

No external libraries needed (uses built-in functions only)
